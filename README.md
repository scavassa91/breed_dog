 - To install NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/)
 - In the root directory, execute ``$ npm install``

To run the serve
``$ npm run start``

``$ npm run test``

To generate de build
``$ npm run build``

## Generate documentation
You need to instal jsdoc globaly runing
``npm install jsdoc -g``

And then, execute this line
``jsdoc src -r -d docs``
